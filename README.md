# Real-time notification and risk quantification of Coronavirus exposure sites within Melbourne, Australia.

## Summary
Checks for new COVID-19 exposure sites, every minute, in Melbourne (Victoria, Australia) and updates web application automatically if there are. Attempts to approximately quantify risk by allowing viewers to digitally notify the app if they were at an exposure site during the exposure period, then uses that data as representative.

## Development
The web application will be built using JavaScript, with computation occuring solely within the client's browser. The _Vue_ [1] application framework will be used, integrating the _Google Maps Platform_ [2] to allow visual representation of the quantification of risk to enhance assessment. Viewers' notification to the app will be implemented also client-side.

## Interested?
I'm looking for mathematical people, as the quantification of risk will be challanging for me (I have a background in computational engineering -- essentially producing nice-looking images using primarily black-box code). I'm also searching for research peeps in the area of perhaps epidemiology with an interest in computational science (disease modelling [3]). Mostly I'm looking for your subscription to Nature. Kidding!
